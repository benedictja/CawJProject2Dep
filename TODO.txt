- deploy maintenance page on loadbalancers
    - add that in the infrasctructure.yml
    - do we want to redeploy it everytime we go into maintenance mode ?
    - can we take a file from the Ansible project as a source to deploy the maintenance page ? 
- update loadbalancers to redirect traffic to the maintenance page instead of the PAZ servers
    - how to update the file(s) to change the config on the NGINX using ansible ?
        - do we try to find specific line in a config file and update it ?
